# **Tails N Trails**

Welcome to the Tails n Trails! Our community is dedicated to bringing dog owners together for regular walks, fostering a friendly environment where both dogs and their owners can enjoy socialising, exploring, and staying active. We are based in the beautiful town of Mullingar, Co. Westmeath, Ireland, and we invite you to join us in our adventures.

## **Website Overview**

Our website is designed to provide you with all the information you need to join our group and start enjoying the many benefits of walking with your dog. Here’s a brief overview of what you’ll find:

### **Existing Features**

- **Nagivation Bar**

  - A fully responsive navigation bar can be seen across all three pages. It includes links to the Home page, Gallery (Pawtraits), and Sign-Up page, and it's identical on each page. This design ensures that users can effortlessly navigate from page to page across all devices without the arduous task of hitting the ‘back’ button.
